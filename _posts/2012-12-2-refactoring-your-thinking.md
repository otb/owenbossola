I spend a lot of time thinking.  In fact, it's something that takes up a large amount of my time -- both day and night.  When I'm focused on a complex problem, thinking can keep me up for hours at night until resolved. I've found that no matter what, the thinking *will* get done.

What I have learned about my process is that most of that time is spent refactoring the input data until it's in its simplest form.  The creative process of problem solving is much like the process of writing, designing, or even coding.  The inputs into your brain are a set of facts, comments, opinions and numerous other data points that can, hopefully, be quantified.

Like a computer those inputs are:

1. compartmentalized,
2. ranked and sorted,
3. discarded,
4. re-evaluated

What I envision is happening is a giant funnel churning on the data, reducing and being re-injected for additional computation. Is there a simple excercise that can help sort this data before it enters the funnel?

What if I pre-sort the inputs into four buckets:

* Facts
* Conditional Statements (if, then)
* Edge cases
* Hopes(+) and Fears(-)

Using a piece of paper with four columns, labeled per the above, I write down the data about the problem when I get stuck on it.  It's the first step towards clarity -- simply organizing all of the data.  I also can rest safely knowing that there's a record of the process.

This technique is new and I'm trying it in hopes that it will save on the brain processing that can at times, be disruptive.  I encourage you to try it, too, and I'll post about how well it works after a few months.
