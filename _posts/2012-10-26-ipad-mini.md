I really like the new [iPad mini][mini].  It's a single-handed device running iOS, which is fantastic.  I can carry it with me on my Subway commute every morning and have more real estate than my phone for consuming content.  I might even pull it out at home and finish the e-books I have in progress.

It's unclear how the market will react to this device, though, since the prices starts at $329 and similar tablets start at $199.  For me, I would only use it for a few apps:

* Kindle
* Reeder
* Pocket
* Flipboard (on occasion as I don't find it as efficient as the above for the same content)

So, essentailly it's an e-book and RSS reader.  Am I better suited w ith a Kindle Paperwhite instead (which is a great deal at $139 for the ad-free version)?  I think so; the more I think about it, specialty devices, like the Kindle are better suited for single functions like reading.  That means, even though the device looks great, I won't be getting one.  Maybe some new killer apps will be released that will change my mind or I might be tempted if it's fit with that performant A6X processor, too, but that's another story.

Whatever happens with the device, it's interesting to see Apple following into this market.  It's not clear if they're going to lead it, yet.  There are now 14 different configurations of iPads.  That's not the mark of focus that Apple as an organization has done so well in during the last ten years.
