I really like the new [iPad mini][mini].  It has a large (enough) screen, is capable of being held in one hand, and runs iOS, all of which is fantastic.  I could carry it with me on my Subway commute every morning and have more real estate than my phone for consuming content.  I might even pull it out at home and finish the e-books I have in progress.

What's unclear is how the market will react to it, since the price starts at $329 and similar tablets start at $199.  For an Apple product owner like myself, there are long term benefits of sticking with the device that largely outweigh a relatively small price difference.

First, I've spent hundreds of dollars on apps that make the device immensely more valuable out of the box.  Next, it will be easy to charge since I'll be accumulating numerous lightning cables and have them placed around the house and at work.  Finally, using the device is like second nature after 5+ years of iOS.   All of these pay dividends in the user experience, which lasts the entire life of the product.

Everyday consumers don't see things this way, though.  It appears like the leaders of this market set the price at $199 and since this device is (yet) to be a status symbol like it's big brother, it might not have a chance to be immensely successful. 

Whatever happens with the device long term, it's interesting to see Apple following into this market.  It's not clear if they're going to lead it and it may damage their reputation if they don't.  Another disturbing point is that there are now 14 (!) different configurations of iPads available.  That's not the mark of focus that Apple as an organization has done so well in during the last ten years.  This could be the start in their loss of dominance.
