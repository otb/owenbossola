I spend a lot of time thinking.  In fact, it's something that takes up a large amount of my time -- both day and night.  When I'm focused on a complex problem, it can keep me up for hours at night until resolved. No matter what, the thinking *will* get done.

What I have learned about my process is that most of that time is spent refactoring the solution until it's in its simplest form.  The creative process of proble solving is much like the process of writing, designing, or even coding.  The inputs into your brain are a set of facts, comments, opinions and numerous other factors that can hopefully be quanitfied.
