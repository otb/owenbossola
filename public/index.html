			<time datetime="2012-10-22 00:00:00 -0400">October 22, 2012</time>
			<p>When trying to solve a problem, the natural instinct is to immediately dive in and find a solution as quickly as possible, especially when under the stress of a deadline.</p>

<p>We should take the time to take a step back and ask ourselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what am I solving for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we do, the answer usually varies and contributes significantly to the desirable solution. On any number of occassions, you can be solving problems with these kinds of goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed</li>

<li>Cost</li>

<li>Wow-factor</li>

<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, however, we end up trying to solve problems while considering numerous goals. For example: how can we make something that is both small to download and visually dense? How can you make a product that has the allure of luxury but is also affordable?</p>

<p>There are endless permutations of the questions we can ask that pertain to the problems we&#8217;re trying to solve. This can be a roadblock that can slow the creative process of brainstorming and discussion solutions. When I&#8217;m stuck, I follow this rule:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when in doubt, solve for simplicity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Framing problems with a simple solution in mind frees the problem-solvers from the complexity that can arise by phrasing numerous questions together. Simple solutions, simply, have less. All the rest is taken away.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how we could reframe the above questions when solving for simplicity: Something that is small to download but is visually less can simply have a smaller footprint to compensate. Or, a luxury good that is also affordable can have minimal packaging to lower costs, raise appeal, and focus solely on the product.</p>

<p>While there can still be challenges in achieving an adequate solution, this helps move beyond the initial phase of deconstructing a problem and producing solutions that achieve a common goal.</p>
