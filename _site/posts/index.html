			<time datetime="2012-10-26 00:00:00 -0400">October 26, 2012</time>
			<p>I really like the new <a href='http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/' title='Apple'>iPad mini</a>. It has a large (enough) screen, is capable of being held in one hand, and runs iOS, all of which is fantastic. I could carry it with me on my Subway commute every morning and have more real estate than my phone for consuming content. I might even pull it out at home and finish the e-books I have in progress.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s unclear is how the market will react to it, since the price starts at $329 and similar tablets start at $199. For an Apple product owner like myself, there are long term benefits of sticking with the device that largely outweigh a relatively small price difference.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;ve spent hundreds of dollars on apps that make the device immensely more valuable out of the box. Next, it will be easy to charge since I&#8217;ll be accumulating numerous lightning cables and have them placed around the house and at work. Finally, using the device is like second nature after 5+ years of iOS. All of these pay dividends in the user experience, which lasts the entire life of the product.</p>

<p>Everyday consumers don&#8217;t see things this way, though. It appears like the leaders of this market set the price at $199 and since this device is (yet) to be a status symbol like it&#8217;s big brother, it might not have a chance to be immensely successful.</p>

<p>Whatever happens with the device long term, it&#8217;s interesting to see Apple following into this market. It&#8217;s not clear if they&#8217;re going to lead it and it may damage their reputation if they don&#8217;t. Another disturbing point is that there are now 14 (!) different configurations of iPads available. That&#8217;s not the mark of focus that Apple as an organization has done so well in during the last ten years. This could be the start in their loss of dominance.</p>

			<a href="/posts/solving-for-simplicity"><h2>Solving for simplicity</h2></a>
			<time datetime="2012-10-22 00:00:00 -0400">October 22, 2012</time>
			<p>When trying to solve a problem, the natural instinct is to immediately dive in and find a solution as quickly as possible, especially when under the stress of a deadline.</p>

<p>We should take the time to take a step back and ask ourselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what are we solving for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we do, the answer usually varies and contributes significantly to the desirable solution. On any number of occassions, we can be solving problems with these kinds of goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed</li>

<li>Cost</li>

<li>Wow-factor</li>

<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, however, we end up trying to solve problems while considering numerous goals. For example: how can we make something that is both small to download and visually dense? How can we make a product that has the allure of luxury but is also affordable?</p>

<p>There are endless permutations of the questions we can ask that pertain to the problems we&#8217;re trying to solve. This can be a roadblock that can slow the creative process of brainstorming and discussing solutions. When I&#8217;m stuck, I follow this rule:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when in doubt, solve for simplicity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Framing problems with a simple solution in mind frees the problem-solvers from the complexity that can arise by phrasing numerous questions together. Simple solutions, simply, have less. All the rest is taken away.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how we could reframe the above questions when solving for simplicity: Something that is small to download but is visually less can simply have a smaller footprint to compensate. Or, a luxury good that is also affordable can have minimal packaging to lower costs, raise appeal, and focus solely on the product.</p>

<p>While there can still be challenges in achieving an adequate solution, this helps move beyond the initial phase of deconstructing a problem and producing solutions that achieve a common goal.</p>
