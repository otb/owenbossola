		<h2>The iPad mini</h2></a>
		<time datetime="2012-10-26 00:00:00 -0400">October 26, 2012</time>
		<p>I really like the new <a href='http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/' title='Apple'>iPad mini</a>. It has a large (enough) screen, is capable of being held in one hand, and runs iOS, all of which is fantastic. I could carry it with me on my Subway commute every morning and have more real estate than my phone for consuming content. I might even pull it out at home and finish the e-books I have in progress.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s unclear is how the market will react to it, since the price starts at $329 and similar tablets start at $199. This device suddenly feels like a big investment.</p>

<p>Then, there&#8217;s the software. For me, I would only use it prmarily for a few apps, all of which have a similar purpose of reading books or articles: Kindle, Reeder, Pocket, Flipboard (on occasion).</p>

<p>That got me thinking I might be better suited with a speciality device if I am to fill this need. The Kindle Paperwhite, which is a great deal at $139 for the ad-free version is much better suited for reading. It may be hard to live without iOS, but that might be a good thing if it&#8217;s going to actually use it to read.</p>

<p>Ultimately&#8230; I would end up getting the iPad mini. The Apple platform effects most aspects of my life already. I&#8217;ve spent hundreds of dollars on apps that make the device immensely more valuable out of the box. I&#8217;ll be accoumulating numerous lightning cables and have them placed around the house and at work for easy charing. Using the device is now like second nature after 5+ years on the platform. Apple, quite simply, has me hooked on their platform.</p>

<p>Everyday consumers are more flexible on these things than I am, though. But, since the iPad mini doesn&#8217;t satisfy the budget conscious or status symbol seekers due to it&#8217;s small size, higher cost, and late entry to the market it&#8217;s success as a product may be limited. Time will tell how it&#8217;s received outside of the Apple techie following.</p>

<p>Whatever happens with the device long term, it&#8217;s interesting to see Apple following into this market. It&#8217;s not clear if they&#8217;re going to lead it, yet, based on the competitive offerings from Google and Amazon. Also, there are now 14 (!) different configurations of iPads available. That&#8217;s not the mark of focus that Apple as an organization has done so well in during the last ten years. This could be the start in their loss of dominance.</p>
