		<h2>The iPad mini</h2></a>
		<time datetime="2012-11-01 00:00:00 -0400">November 01, 2012</time>
		<p>I really like the new <a href='http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/' title='Apple'>iPad mini</a>. It has a large (enough) screen, is capable of being held in one hand, and runs iOS, all of which is fantastic. It&#8217;s easily portable for my Subway commute each morning and would have more real estate than my iPhone for consuming content. I might even pull it out at home and finish the e-books I have in progress.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s unclear is how the market will react to it, since the price starts at $329 and similar tablets start at $199. For an Apple product owner like myself, there are long term benefits of sticking with the device that largely outweigh a relatively small price difference.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;ve spent hundreds of dollars on apps that make the device immensely more valuable out of the box. Next, it will be easy to charge since I&#8217;ll be accumulating numerous lightning cables and have them placed around the house and at work. Finally, using the device is like second nature after 5+ years of iOS. All of these pay dividends in the user experience, which lasts the entire life of the product.</p>

<p>Everyday consumers don&#8217;t see things this way, though. The leaders of this market set the price at $199 and since this device is (yet) to be a status symbol like it&#8217;s big brother, it might not have a chance to be immensely successful.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s success has been with focused, market-defining products, not by following others. It&#8217;s not clear how well the iPad mini will do against established competitors, but it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see what happens next. Being the leader in consumper products, Apple has plenty to lose and there is no shortage of companies ready to step up if they do.</p>
