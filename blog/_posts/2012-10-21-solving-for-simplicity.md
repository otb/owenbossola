title: When in doubt, solve for simplicity

Often times, when approached with problems, the natural instinct is to immediately dive in and find a solution as quickly as possible, especially when under the stress of a deadline.

What we don't often do is take a stepback and ask ourselves:

> what am I solving for?

The answer usually varies and contributes significantly to the desirable solution.  On any number of occassions, you can be solving problems with these kinds of solutions in mind:

* Speed
* Cost
* Wow-factor
* Efficiency

There are other times when what you're solving for can't easily be determined since you don't have enough data about your users, or, more often, there are too many variables to solve for.  How can we make something that is both small to download and visually dense?  How can you make a product that has the allure of luxury but is also affordable?  There are endless permutations of the questions we can ask that pertain to the problems we're trying to solve.  This can be a roadblock that can slow the creative process of brainstorming and discussion solutions.  When I'm stuck, I follow this rule:

> when in doubt, solve for simplicity

Framing problems with a simple solution in mind frees the problem-solvers from the complexity that can arise by phrasing numerous questions together.

Simple solutions have less.  For exmaple, Something that is small to download but is visually less can simply have a smaller footprint to compensate.  Also, a luxury good that is also affordable can have minimal packaging to lower costs, raise appeal, and focus solely on the product.

While there can still be challenges and achieving an adequate solution, this helps move beyond the initial phase of deconstructing a problem and producting solutions that achieve a common goal.
